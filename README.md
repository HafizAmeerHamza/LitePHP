# LitePHP

LitePHP is a lightweight, Laravel-inspired PHP framework built from scratch.  
It provides a clean and minimal structure for modern PHP applications without relying on heavy frameworks or external dependencies.  

## âœ¨ Features
- Custom routing system (similar to Laravel)
- MVC-like structure (Controllers, Views, Models)
- API-ready routing support
- Layouts and view rendering
- Route helpers for easy navigation
- Clean and minimal core â€” no external libraries

## ðŸš€ Why LitePHP?
If you love Laravelâ€™s structure but need something lightweight and dependency-free, LitePHP gives you the same development flow in plain PHP.
